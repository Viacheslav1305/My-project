          Blackglama is indeed a unique and very rare type of mink, the amount of which from world production is about 2%, which allowed our brand to occupy the most exclusive niche.

        <h3 id=section-header>History of BLACKGLAMA</h3>
        <p>The Great Lakes Mink Association (GLMA) was formed in 1941 by mink breeders in the Great Lakes region of the United States who bred a black-furred mink which they characterize as "the richest, deepest, most lustrous dark mink with the lightest, most flexible leather", and trademarked it as Blackglama. Their long-running advertising campaign is known by the tagline "What becomes a legend most?", featuring a series of celebrities modeling their furs. The name "Blackglama" is a play on the word "glamor" and the initialism "GLMA"</p>
